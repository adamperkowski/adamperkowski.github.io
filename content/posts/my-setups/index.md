This post is going to be updated. A lot. Probably. Maybe...

So yeah. My so called 'rices':

# DWM

This is the one I actively use on my main PC. I spent **a lot** of time on it.<br>
I patched the window manager exactly how I like it, with the exact functionality I need.

I even made advanced installation and update scripts that are fully automated and work flawlessly.

Here are some previews (sorry for the quality):

And of course, everything's available in a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adamperkowski/dwm).
